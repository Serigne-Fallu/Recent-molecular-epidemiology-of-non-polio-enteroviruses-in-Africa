# Recent molecular epidemiology of non-polio enteroviruses in Africa  

## 🧾 Overview  
This repository contains the data, scripts, and analyses associated with our study on the molecular epidemiology and transmission dynamics of **human non-polio enteroviruses (NPEVs)** in Africa. The project combines **genomic data from GenBank** and sequences generated by the **Intercountry Reference Laboratory for Polio at the Institut Pasteur de Dakar**.  

Using a **Bayesian inference framework**, we explored spatiotemporal dynamics, inter-host transmission, and recombination patterns across enterovirus species. Our work highlights Africa’s central role in the global circulation of NPEVs, while also underlining critical research gaps.

## 📄 Abstract  
Enteroviruses are among the most prevalent human-infecting viruses worldwide. They cause diseases such as encephalitis, meningitis, and neonatal infections. Human non-polio enteroviruses represent major public health concerns due to frequent outbreaks. However, their transmission dynamics in Africa remain poorly understood.  

Our study used genomic data from GenBank and the Intercountry Reference Laboratory for Polio at the Institut Pasteur de Dakar. A Bayesian inference framework was used to estimate spatiotemporal and inter-host transmission patterns. Whole genome sequences were screened for recombination analysis.  

- **Substitution rates** ranged from *0.52×10⁻² to 2.29×10⁻² substitutions per site per year* for all NPEV species except B, which showed a higher rate (*3.11×10⁻²; p=0.044*).  
- The **common ancestors** of NPEV species existed *31–188 years ago*.  
- **Phylogeographic analyses** highlight Africa's pivotal role in global circulation, with Senegal, Cameroon, Ghana, and South Africa identified as major hubs.  
- **Host dynamics**: non-human primates are key reservoirs for species A, B, and D, while humans are primary hosts for species C.  
- **Recombination** was frequent among Enterovirus B.  

This study emphasizes the need for **sustained surveillance and research** to fill critical gaps in understanding NPEVs circulation, host dynamics, and public health impact in Africa.

## 🧪 Materials and Methods  

### 📊 Data collection and curation  
Data were collected from **GenBank-NCBI** and the **Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center (BV-BRC)** databases. These datasets included complete **VP1 protein sequences** and **whole-genome sequences** of NPEVs.  

**Queries used for curation:**  
- Species A: `(Enterovirus) AND 'Enterovirus A'[porgn:_txid138948]`  
- Species B: `(Enterovirus) AND 'Enterovirus B'[porgn:_txid138949]`  
- Species C: `(Enterovirus) AND 'Enterovirus C'[porgn:_txid138950]`  
- Species D: `(Enterovirus) AND 'Enterovirus D'[porgn: txid138951]`  

Additional sequences were obtained from the **Intercountry Reference Laboratory for Poliomyelitis (Institut Pasteur de Dakar, Senegal)**.  

**Exclusion criteria:**  
1. Missing collection dates or geographic regions.  
2. Sequences with >10% ambiguous bases (N).  
3. Non-human NPEV sequences.  

Data curation, cleaning, and metadata visualization were performed in **R (v4.4.0)** with **RStudio IDE**.
